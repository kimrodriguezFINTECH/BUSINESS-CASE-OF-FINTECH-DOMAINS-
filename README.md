Whenever you buy or sell a stock there are two important dates which are the transation date and the settlement date that must be done within a certain amount of time. However, with Blockchain buying and selling stock can be transfered and settleed almost institanous. Thus, by eliminating that setlement time this can reduce or even elimnate counter party risk.
