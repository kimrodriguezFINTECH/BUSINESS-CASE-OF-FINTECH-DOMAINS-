### BUSINESS-CASE-OF-FINTECH-DOMAINS-

## Early Beginnigns of J.P Morgan Chase Corporation  

J.P Morgan & Chase Corporation is built on 1,200 predecessor institutions that have come together over the years to form today's company. Many of these predecessor institutions consisted of well-known heritage firms such as, The Chase Manhattan Bank, Bank One, The First National Bank of Chicago, National Bank of Detroit, The Bear Stearns Companies Inc.; even the business acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction, etc. Each of these firms, in its time, were innovative financial institutions that contributed to the growth of the U.S. and global economies. That being so, J.P. Morgan continues to uphold these standards by now offering the JPM Coin, a digital dollar backed by a private version of Etherem Blockchain on Onyx. 

## JPM Coin & Blockchain

The JPM Coin was introduced back in 2019, as a permissioned blockchain that serves as a payment rail and deposit account ledger. This blockchain allows clients to transfer US Dollars held on deposit within the J.P. Morgan client system. Furthermore, this blockchain system moves all funds or payments to many parts of the world and time zones at any given time. The JPM Coin system has the technological capability to support advance payment types like DvP (Delivery versus Payment), PvP (Payment versus Payment) and machine-to-machine payments to help solve common hurdles of traditional cross border payments.

## Onyx & Blockchain

Onyx created by J.P. Morgan in 2020, was the first global bank to offer a blockchain-based platform for wholesale payments transactions. Onyx is redirecting the way money, information, and assets are moving around domestically and around the world with. Onyx's blockchain-based platform further advances J.P. Morgan institutional banking by creating a reliable infrastructure and services, to help solve some of the most compelling banking problems that relate to digital assets, payments, and confidential information sharing within banking. Overall, J.P. Morgan designed Onyx to facilitate instantaneous payments round the clock, and to provide business to business money movement/commerce by using JPM Coin. In return, blockchain provides a more secure transfer when doing thes financial trasactions. 

## Why Blockchain?

J.P. Morgan Chase & Corporation was founded by J.P Morgan who launched the House of Morgan on 23 Wall street in 1871 and was incorprated on December 31, 2000. With J.P Morgan's reputable background in innovation it comes to no surpise that this idea of using blockchain for collateral settlemments and using JPM Coin as a source of value came to light in the company's lastes finaicla inovations. Not to mention, blockchain allows investors to put down a wider range of assets as collateral and will be able to even use them outside of market operating hours. More over, since JPM Coin functions as a source of value this will let transfers and settlements be available 24/7.

As of recently, it is predicted that JPM Coin could be handling as much as $10 billion in daily transactions within the next year or two, according to Umar Farooq, head of the bank's Global Head of Financial Institution Payments. Overall, JPMorgan's digital token JPM Coin now handles $1 billion worth of transactions daily according to Global Head of Payments, Takis Georgakopoulos. 

## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 
As mentioned JPM Coin is trying to resolve problems some of the most compelling banking problems that relate to transfer of digital assets, payments, and confidential information sharing within banking. For example transfer of assets can take hours or even days for a settlment to happen depending on what financial transaction is being done. In addition, there are always constant frictions and risks that come with these types of transactions. 

Example 1: 
Whenever you buy or sell a stock there are two important dates which is the transation date and the settlement date, that must be done within a certain amount of time. However, with Blockchain buying and selling stock can be transfered and settleed almost institanous. With blockhain not considering that time frame in the settlement this can reduce or even elimnate counter party risk. 


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Company Intended Customers:
1. Corporate Banking 
2. Investment Banking 
3. Retail/Commercial Banking 
4. Asset/ Wealth Management 

Market Size of Set of Customers: ??????????

Cryptocurrency/Coin Based Market 
Market size value in 2023: USD 2,444.77 million
Revenue forecast in 2032: USD 6,574.73 million

Solutions that other competitors do not or cannot offer: 
1. Support domestic and cross-border payments
2. Corporate clients to make programmable, real-time, multi-currency payments using multi-bank shared ledgers
3. Payment applications for FX, securities settlement and other value-added services made possible by J.P. Morgan-developed blockchain technology
4. 24/7 transfers using blockchain technology to help provide better treasury solutions to corporate clients with complex global treasury needs
5. Fungible cross-currency liquidity, enabling creation of customizable structures like virtual accounts on blockchain, multi-currency notional pools
6. programmable money capability has the potential to enhance liquidity management for corporate clients through conditional payments governed programmatically by distributed ledger technology

Example: Let's say a client may want to borrow $1.2 million for three hours. In the mean time Onyx can use smart contracts to automate delivery versus payment at the right times using precise terms so there is no middle or back office processing; according to Tyrone Lobban, head of Onyx Digital Assets & Blockchain at JP Morgan.
Clients can get same day liquidity through a secured transaction using JPM Coin as collateral, rather than having to draw an expensive unsecured line of credit with high interest rates which usually takes about one to multiple business days.
