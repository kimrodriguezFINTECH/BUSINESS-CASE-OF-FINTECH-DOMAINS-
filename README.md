### BUSINESS-CASE-OF-FINTECH-DOMAINS-

## Early Beginnigns of J.P Morgan Chase Corporation  

J.P Morgan & Chase Corporation is built on 1,200 predecessor institutions that have come together over the years to form today's company. Many of these predecessor institutions consisted of well-known heritage firms such as, The Chase Manhattan Bank, Bank One, The First National Bank of Chicago, National Bank of Detroit, The Bear Stearns Companies Inc.; even the business acquired in the Washington Mutual transaction, etc. Each of these firms, in its time, were innovative financial institutions that contributed to the growth of the U.S. and global economies. That being so, J.P. Morgan continues to uphold these standards by now offering the JPM Coin, a digital dollar backed by a private version of Ethereum Blockchain on Onyx. 

## JPM Coin & Blockchain

The JPM Coin was introduced back in 2019, as a permissioned blockchain that serves as a payment rail and deposit account ledger. This blockchain allows clients to transfer US Dollars held on deposit within the J.P. Morgan client system. Furthermore, this blockchain system moves all funds or payments to many parts of the world and time zones at any given time. The JPM Coin system has the technological capability to support advance payment types like DvP (Delivery versus Payment), PvP (Payment versus Payment) and machine-to-machine payments to help solve common hurdles of traditional cross border payments.

## Onyx & Blockchain

Onyx created by J.P. Morgan in 2020, was the first global bank to offer a blockchain-based platform for wholesale payments transactions. Onyx is redirecting the way money, information, and assets are moving around domestically and around the world with. Onyx's blockchain-based platform further advances J.P. Morgan institutional banking by creating a reliable infrastructure and services, to help solve some of the most compelling banking problems that relate to digital assets, payments, and confidential information sharing within banking. Overall, J.P. Morgan designed Onyx to facilitate instantaneous payments round the clock, and to provide business to business money movement/commerce by using JPM Coin. In return, blockchain provides a more secure transfer when doing these financial transactions. 

## Why Blockchain?

J.P. Morgan Chase & Corporation was founded by J.P Morgan who launched the House of Morgan on 23 Wall Street in 1871 and was incorporated on December 31, 2000. With J.P Morgan's reputable background in innovation it comes to no surprise that this idea of using blockchain for collateral settlements and using JPM Coin as a source of value came to light in the company's latest financial innovations. Not to mention, blockchain allows investors to put down a wider range of assets as collateral and will be able to even use them outside of market operating hours. Moreover, since JPM Coin functions as a source of value this will let transfers and settlements be available 24/7. Most importantly, blockchain data base is extremely difficult to manipulate or reverse engineer, which now and days this kind of technology leaves a lot of companies vulnerable to cyber-attacks.  

## Market Size of Digital Coin: 

The market size for digital coin based on Cryptocurrency/Coin based market is:
Market size value in 2023: USD 2,444.77 million
Revenue forecast in 2032: USD 6,574.73 million

## Landscape:

Onyx by JP Morgan Chase is the private version of Etherem Blockchain domain. However, companies like Glaxy, Riot, and Silvergate participate externally which is probably why they are preforming better than Onyx. 

## Top 3 Major Companies/Trends in Blockchain

1. Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd (BRPHF)
Revenue (TTM): $457 million (As of Sept. 30, 2022)
Net Income (TTM): -$682.6 million

"Galaxy provides access to the crypto economy as a digital asset and blockchain leader for institutions, startups, and qualified individuals. Galaxy serves the digital economy with financial services such as trading, asset management, investment banking, mining, and ventures (Johnston, 2023)."

2. Riot Blockchain Inc. (RIOT)
Revenue (TTM): $289.9 million
Net Income (TTM): -$386.7 million

## Problems & Resolutions: 

As mentioned JPM Coin is trying to resolve problems some of the most compelling banking problems that relate to transfer of digital assets, payments, and confidential information sharing within banking. For example, transfer of assets can take hours or even days for a settlement to happen depending on what financial transaction is being done. In addition, there are always constant frictions and risks that come with these types of transactions. 

# Example: 

Whenever you buy or sell a stock there are two important dates which is the transaction date and the settlement date, that must be done within a certain amount of time. However, with blockchain buying and selling stock can be transferred and settled almost instantaneously. With blockchain not considering that time frame in the settlement this can reduce or even eliminate counter party risk. 

# Solutions that other competitors do not or cannot offer: 

1. Support domestic and cross-border payments
2. Corporate clients can make programmable in real-time, multi-currency payments using multi-bank shared ledgers
3. Payment applications for FX, securities settlement and other value-added services made possible by J.P. Morgan-developed blockchain technology
4. 24/7 transfers using blockchain technology to help provide better treasury solutions to corporate clients with complex global treasury needs
5. Fungible cross-currency liquidity, enabling creation of customizable structures like virtual accounts on blockchain, multi-currency notional pools
6. Programmable money capability has the potential to enhance liquidity management for corporate clients through conditional payments governed programmatically by distributed ledger technology
7. Blockchain security system makes it extremely difficult to manipulate or reverse engineer the software. 

# Example:

Let's say a client may wants to borrow $1.2 million for three hours. For this case Onyx can use smart contracts to automate delivery versus payment at the right times using precise terms so there is no middle or back-office processing; according to Tyrone Lobban, head of Onyx Digital Assets & Blockchain at JP Morgan. Thus, clients can get same day liquidity through a secured transaction using JPM Coin as collateral, rather than having to draw an expensive unsecured line of credit with high interest rates which usually takes about one to multiple business days.

## Targeted Customers for Onyx:

1. Corporate Banking 
2. Investment Banking 
3. Asset/ Wealth Management 

## Technology at JPM Morgan Chase 

Tech Stack List: 

1. Python
On October 10, 2023 J.P. Morgan announced the launch of its Securities Services Data Mesh for institutional investors. The securities services will be available through Fusion by J.P. Morgan (Fusion). Investors will be able to retrieve important investment data held by J.P. Morgan’s Custody, Fund Accounting and Middle Office services, using cloud-native channels including REST APIs, Jupyter notebooks and the Snowflake Financial Services Data Cloud. Working side by side with cloud native channels, Fusion makes integrating asset servicing data easier to use at a large scale especially as portfolios and investments form in size and complexity

2. BlockChain 

Blockchain technology improves funds transfers between banking institutions globally, including payments originating from Taiwan banks to beneficiary banks in other markets. How they will implement this is by using a new solution called Confirm that helps reduce the number of rejected or returned transactions caused by mismatched payment details, lowering costs for both the sending, and receiving banks. Banking institutions will be able to request confirmation of the beneficiary account information and receive responses directly from other participating banks in almost no time. Once the information is validated, the payment may be sent through J.P. Morgan’s global clearing solution Pay Direct to route the payment in the most efficient manner. 

Why Python and Blockchain? (My Opinion)
Python and Blockchain are most relevent to this case study considering what we have convered thus far, in class.

## Results

# Fundings for Onyx

It is hard to say exactly how much funding went into Onyx however down below is a chart of the company's free cashflow over the past 8 years that could of been used to fund this project.  

![CASHFLOW](images/JPM CASHFLOW.png)

As of recently, it is predicted that JPM Coin could be handling as much as $10 billion in daily transactions within the next year or two, according to Umar Farooq, head of the bank's Global Head of Financial Institution Payments. Overall, JPMorgan's digital token JPM Coin now handles $1 billion worth of transactions daily according to Global Head of Payments, Takis Georgakopoulos. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

# Recommendation #1: Create Onyx for External Users

Benefits: 

1. Possibly increase profits like Glaxy, Riot, and Silvergate whom participate externally which is probably why they are performing better than Onyx.
2. Branching out to other banks or institutions in the long run can fund alot more projects J.P.M wants to venture into without using their own cashflow because in return these companies will be charged a fee or royalties for using Onyx.

# Technologies for Additional Services:

1. Python

Python will be able to create multiple outcomes for multiple markets in the world not just in the banking business. Python can make create a snipet for other companies prior to them venturing into a possible deal with other companies or markets. Lastly, no matter what industry outcomes can be generated and updated even as new industries arrive in the market. 

2. BlockChain 

Continuing to use Blockchain technology as Onys is using now internally will provide the same results as mentioned just as a larger scale into mutiple markets. 

4. Extension of Onyx

It is also recommended that J.P.M make a different branch in Onyx solely for external financial transactions so their customers and businesses will not be compromised. 

# Recomendation #2: Create Onyx for Mergers & Aquisitions

# Benefits:

1. Facilite even more business in selling/buying/merging businesses. 
2. Possibly eliminate discrepencies when evaluating a company.
3. Possibly eliminate monopolies. 

# Technologies for Additional Services:

Some of the same technologies should be used for this type of service since Onyx's technology is working just fine internally.

1. Python

 Python will provide mutiple outcomes for the kinds of businesses that would be a good fit to merge together. Further more, create mutiple outcomes whether one company should sell or not proceed with a business opportunity. Also being able to identify early on whether a company merging together will cause a monopoly which will help avoid federal law suits. 

2. BlockChain 

This will make the transfer of selling/buying/merging a company a easier when it comes to the financial aspects or being able to share updates at anytime. Most importantly, protect the company from any losses in which some cases a company might of lied in their financial statements when it came to evaluating the company, for example. 

3. SQL
The programming language is essential for financial analysis as it offers the ability to collect, store, and analyze financial data, and work with data visualization tools to see if an mergers and aqusition should happen. SQL improves the analysts' ability to manage and analyze excessive amounts of data safely and efficiently. Most importantly SQL databases can generate predictive models and data-driven business decisions that some companies cannot forsee in the present day.
